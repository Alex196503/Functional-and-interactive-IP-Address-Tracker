Interactive API that respects the design. In this challenge, i took contact with two different APIs using asynchronous programming(async and await), inspected their documentation. Also, I tried to build the design
as close as possible to the original one.
Built With:
Semantic HTML,
CSS custom properties,
CSS pseudo-elements,
CSS states,
CSS variables,
CSS flexbox,
Raw JS,
Two APIs.
